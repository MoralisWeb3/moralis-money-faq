# üëã Welcome to Moralis Money FAQ!

Here you will find all the answers to the most common questions about https://moralismoney.com

# How do filters work?

## üïö Coin Age

Measures the time since the coin was minted.

## üí∏ Buyers

Measures how many new addresses bought the coin during the specified time-frame.

Any address who has zero coins and uses a DEX to buy some coins during the specified time-frame is counted as a buyer.

## üí∏üë¥ Experienced Buyers

Same as Buyers with the additional requirement that the address needs to have at least 100 outgoing transactions to be qualified.

(we are working on adding additional requirements such as the age of the address)

## üí¶ Liquidity

Measures how much liquidity changed during the specified time-frame.

## üíé Holders

Measures how much holders changed during the specified time-frame.

# When are more filters coming??

We are working on new filters every day - expect new filers to pop up regularly!

# Is Moralis Money fully automatic or is there any manual coin ranking?

Moralis Money is purely automatic, we collect data from the blockchain and different third party APIs and present the data according to the filters and sorting criteria you specify in the UI.

We don't do any manual processing of the data or any manual coin ranking.

We do evolve the automatic algorithms and add more filters and sorting criteria.

The changes we do apply to all coins.

# Can I adjust the definition of the filters, introduce own filters etc?

Right now - not. In the future - HELL YEA ü§©üî•

# üìà Why will Moralis Money 10x in value over the coming months?

1. **Altcoin season coming** - first and foremost, Moralis Money will automatically become more valuable as the bull market returns and altcoins start flying. The tools we provide will become even more invaluable when the potential returns are 10-100x higher in an altcoin season in comparison to today. 
2. **Price increases coming** - As the bull market is coming back we will increase our prices. We want the paid features to be exclusive. They are extremely valuable. We have already announced a [50% increase in price when Bitcoin reaches $30,000 - from $97 to $197 per month](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/moralis-money-faq/blob/main/price-increase-30k-bitcoin.md). If you buy the pro plan today we will honor the current price for you as long as you stay subscribed. Therefore it is very important that you subscribe right now if you are serious about this bull market and like our product.
3. **Alerts Coming** - We will soon launch Token Alerts - meaning that you can save a query and receive emails whenever new coins fit the criteria in that query. Imagine you have a query such as `Give me all coins on Polygon that were minted today which have been bought by at least 1000 whales` - you will see very few coins qualifying for such criteria. But you know that if a coin ever meets this criteria - you want to buy it asap. Using our alerts you will be notified about such coins in real time.
4. **Extensive Security Coming** - In the coming months we plan to 10x the amount of information we give about the security of each coin in order to ensure that you have as much info as possible to avoid scams and rug pulls.
5. **10x More Filters** - We are already working hard on new filters, such as `Profitable Whales`, `Profitable Meme Coin Investors` and many many other. The current filters are just a small teaser of what's about to come.
6. **Token Dashboard** - search any token and see all info about the token

**In summary - we are just at the very early stages of our product and we are so excited to all the early adopters that are becoming paid subscribers. We will honor the low prices we offer today if you stay subscribed. We can't wait to share these bull market times with you ü§©üìà**


# ‚ö°Ô∏è How fast is new data ingested?

Moralis Money offers different time frames for each filter.

<img width="1001" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-09 at 13 54 01" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11097108/224029126-54385ed1-8ed8-4964-bf4c-9294000f9006.png">

The lowest time-frame we currently support dictates refresh rate for all time-frames.

Each interval of the lowest time frame we recalculate all other time frames and roll up the data.

We plan to support even lower time frames in the future.


# Roadmap

1. Get coins with higher/lower marketcap than X
2. Get coins with higher/lower volume than X in a specified time-frame
3. Experienced Traders - addresses that have proven trading track-record
4. Filters based on % of supply locked/% of LP tokens locked
5. Getting email alerts for queries

# Recently shipped

1. First iteration of Optimism integration (uniswap done, velodrome pending)
2. Saving Queries
3. Arbitrum integration
4. More logo support


# Optimism FAQ

## Why are there few coins on Optimism?

There are 2 reasons:

1) We only support Uniswap currently, we are integrating Velodrome which will add more coins
2) Even when Velodrome is added the number of projects on Optimism will be low compared to other chains as Optimism doesnt have a lot of activity as it is still a new chain.

According to DEXScreener:
1. Optimism has 508 pairs
2. Arbitrum has 1750 pairs
3. Ethereum has 5000 pairs

## How is Moralis Money different from other on-chain analytics platforms?

1. Moralis Money is different from other on-chain analytics platforms because we give simple tools that unlock true alpha. The information we provide is easy to apply in the markets and integrate into your daily trading. **Other platforms that try to compete with us often waste your time with endless charts and other non-actionable on-chain data.**
2. Moralis Money is made by people who have a good track record trading altcoins (for example Ivan on Tech was one of the first people to get into MATIC at just a few cents). **Other platforms that try to compete with us often are made by data-scientists without trading experience. Their tools don't help you become successful in crypto, they just provide information overload.**

## Can you really make money in crypto?

Absolutely, MATIC did over 100x during the past few years, same with Solana, AAVE and many other altcoins.

As long as you are early, and have the correct tools - you have great chance of making it BIG.

Crypto is the only industry where a 100-500x is possible within just a few years.

So if you want to make a real difference for yourself in a short period of time - you have arrived at the right place üôå

# Using Moralis Money 

We get a lot of questions about how to use Moralis Money. We have an in-depth tutorial and instruction manual in the works and it will be done soon ü§©üé•

In the meanwhile, we would like to address some common questions about day to day use of Moralis Money here.

## Do I need to buy some altcoin fast? I dont want to miss any opportunity and I want to put Moralis Money to use already today by getting into some altcoins ASAP!! üòú

This depends on your experience. 

The best traders first learn the tool well before making any real trades and risking real money.

A common strategy we see successful users follow is to not make any fast decisions at the start and instead get a feel for the tool, the market, how the coins behave and how the filters work. 

This way they build the internal confidence and develop an understanding of the altcoin market.

A good strategy could be to make fake trades on paper to begin with, and see how the coins perform before deploying real capital.

At the end of the day - it is all about risk management. You can be the best trader in the world, make 1000 great trades and lose it all in one bad trade if you dont manage risk.

Time is on your side. 

There is always something that will pump tomorrow, you don't have to catch all pumps.

So education and practice first - risk taking later.


## Which filters do you recommend to use? ü§î

It all depends on your strategy.

If you are new to using Moralis Money you can try some of the pre-made filters we showcase on the home page.

<img width="1067" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-02 at 21 46 35" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11097108/229375482-62403219-1068-4a84-b67e-319b3154d78d.png">

For example by using the `Coin Age` filter you can see which coins are minted today, yesterday, during the last week etc

You can then apply `Security Score` filter to filter out all the potential scams.

We will soon push many many more filters and do more practical demos of how everything works üôå

## Which chains do you recommend to use? ‚õìÔ∏è

Most people use Ethereum to learn the tool and get started because it has the most coins and the most activity.

However there are many opportunities on other chains so feel free to explore all of them ü§©

## What coins are you buying? I want to buy what you buy! ü§ë

This is a common question our team gets. Sometimes we discuss our picks on Ivan on Tech YouTube üî• But the problem with following what other people are doing is that you never find true hidden gems. If something is already on YouTube it is by definition not a hidden gem.

That is why it is important that you learn Moralis Money and find your own path.

Moralis Money is designed to be simple to use and get started with, but there is an unlimited number of ways you can combine the filters, timeframes and chains which allows everyone to find their own unique nische and develop a personal strategy.

Developing your own strategy is like discovering your own super power. It allows you to find opportunities without relying on someone else.

Most importantly - it builds your confidence and independence as a trader.
