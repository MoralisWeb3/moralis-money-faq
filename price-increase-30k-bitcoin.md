## TLDR

TLDR - when Bitcoin reaches 30k we will increase the Pro plan price from $97 to $197.

If you buy now at $97 - you keep this price as long as you stay subscribed.

If you like what you see - you should ensure to be set for the bull market by locking in the $97 deal asap.

The printer is going brrrr, dollar becoming worthless, inflation etc

Moralis Money subscription is mooning in dollar terms simply put.
