# Verified Tokens


## What are verified tokens?

Verified tokens are manually selected by the Moralis team in order to give an extra layer of vetting for our users and build trust in the altcoin ecosystem.

## How to get your coin verified

There are two ways to get verified:

1. **Automatic verification** - if a token has a long track record with many daily users, deep liquidity, thousands of holders, and transactions we may verify it automatically.
2. **Manual verification** - available to all tokens and requires quarterly verification in the form of a call with the Moralis Team in which we assess if the token is eligible for manual verification. The cost for this is $2,500 per month and the minimum time we accept is 6 months to ensure that the token project is committed to its long-term success.

To request manual verification please email support@moralis.io and describe your project.
